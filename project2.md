# Game 2: Playful Practice

Although this class has looked at play design in the context of games, elements of play can be incorporated into nearly anything. Your goal for this project is to incorporate play into your own design practice. If your own design practice involves games, make a game! However, you should feel free to add play design to an industrial design object, an architectural design, a theoretical/speculative society, an app, etc, should that hew closer to your own motivations for exploring play design.

For this project, you may work in pairs or in threes.

_For groups of three, you must get approval. Groups of three must provide:_

1.  A set schedule of times where all three members of the group can meet, at least 3 days per week. You don't necessarily need to Zoom 3x per week, however, you may need to meet at different parts of the week during different phases of the project, like before then during a playtest.
2.  A clear delineation of roles. This does not mean that there can't be overlap between team-members and the delineation doesn't need to be skill-specific; I just need to see what each person is doing and I need to ensure that everyone is doing game design (eg, it is bad if one person just does graphic design and no game design).

### Part I: Brainstorm

_Due April 7_

Think of an experience you want to create for players. This is before you even think about mechanics and specific interactions. Something like, "I want to create an immersive narrative experience that evokes mystery" or "I want someone who uses my app to feel like they're in a fun competition with themselves."

### Part II: Proposal

_Due April 14_

Be prepared to give a brief (under 10 minutes) presentation of your game proposal. We will have time to discuss the proposed games after the presentations

We will see the presentations together as a class then split into two breakout rooms for discussion.

Prepare the following slides:

- Team name
- What's your design value &amp; the core experience you want your players to have?
- How do you plan to use game design tools to shape the game elements to serve that experience?
- What is your intended prototype or prototypes? What questions do you aim to ask then answer through your prototype?
- At least three questions you would like to discuss.

### <a name="ii"></a>Part III: Prototype

_Due April 21_

- Noting that you have one week to prototype and playtest, what's a slice of your desired experience that you can put together?
- Develop at least three design questions you would like your playtest to answer. These should be both for yourself and for your players.
- Begin making a prototype that can answer these questions. Have it ready to show during team meeting.
- Define about how long it will take to playtest the game and how many people can play (minimum and maximum)

### <a name="iii"></a>Part IV: Playtest & Iterate

_Due April 28_

- Continue developing your prototype to a playtestable state
- Playtest your game with at least 3 different sets of people
- Document your playtest
- Summarize

### <a name="iv"></a>Part V: Playtest & Document

_Due May 5_

- Add your project to the shared slide deck.

Add the following slides:

- Team member names, project title, kinds of play; one-line or one-paragraph description
- A document detailing the rules of your game.
- Documentation of your prototype
- 3+ images of your game (including playtest)
- Optional: video summary of playtest

### Criteria

- Fidelity of imagery, sound, etc is unimportant at this stage; an unattractive game will not harm your grade and a beautiful game will not benefit your grade.

### Form &amp; Tools

- Your game must be playtestable remotely on whatever computer other students are using. (So no heavy-duty Unreal or VR projects!)
- There are no other constraints regarding form. You can design a game intended to be a physical boardgame or card game, then create it in Miro/Mural/etc for playtesting.
- There is no constraint regarding tools. Recommended tools are listed on the class website. I'd recommend looking at the tools that create simple virtual spaces like Hubs or Gather if you want to re-create aspects of an in-person performative game.
