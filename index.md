### Schedule

_Abbreviations: GDP (Games, Design, and Play); RoP (Rules of Play)_

The linked slides were created by the authors of _Games, Design, and Play_, Colleen Macklin and John Sharp, and follow the text very closely. I have made a handful of edits for clarity.

For each journal, play a game of your choice for at least 1-2 hours then write about it according to the prompt. Ask in Slack if you want a recommendation. Please submit journals by noon the day before class so I can compile questions & references for the class discussion.

Class recordings are archived on [Google Drive]({{page.recordings}}).

### Course Description

This class is for students who are interested in game design and the creation of interactive experiences. The class focuses on game design and prototyping computer games and other types of games through structured game design problems, exercises, lectures, and reading. The emphasis will be on an iterative design methodology, playtesting, user experience, and clear concept development. The goal of the class is to explore how design systems (in this case, games) support interactivity through meaningful play. This class focuses on the design of games and playful experiences, and will not focus on specific game programming techniques.

In this class, we will evaluate different aspects of games and play: structural (systems/formal), aesthetic (visual, aural, experiential), affective (emotional response), social (engagement with others), and political (implications for and impact on society).

### Learning Outcomes

By the successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the relationship between games and play.
2. Design games and other play-based activities from a play-centric perspective.
3. Plan and run diagnostic playtests.
4. Consider play design as a broad creative discipline.
5. Collaboratively conceptualize, prototype, playtest, and evaluate play experiences.
